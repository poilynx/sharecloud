# sharecloud

sharecloud is a PHP project to provide filehosting features for private users and their friends.

# Requirements

Currently we support all webspace servers, virtual servers (vServer) and all root servers. There should be no problems if you can fulfil following requirements:

* PHP 5.3.2+
* MySQL 5+ (or MariaDB)
* Apache 2.x or nginx (other servers are not officially supported but should work with some tweaks)

Optional
* php-imagick
* php-rar

# Installation
We provide some installation guides [here](docs/install/installation.md).

# Upgrade
When we release a new version of our software, make sure you follow our upgrade guides [here](docs/upgrade/upgrade.md)

# Unofficial guides
We also provide guides for those who want to use different software (like nginx) [here](docs/recipes/recipes.md)
